## Overview and Purpose
As a doctoral student specializing in human-technology interaction, I am interested in exploring the evolving research landscape within this field, and my driving question is: “How have research trends in human-computer interaction evolved and correlated over the last decade?” I plan to use data visualization techniques to comprehensively analyze the trends and themes in research topics, authorship patterns, and citation patterns by examining articles from two leading journals: Computers in Human Behavior and the International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, which are influential in the human-computer/technology interaction and provide a rich dataset for understanding research dynamics over time. I will also investigate virtual reality as a specific area of interest within this broader field to uncover underexplored aspects and drive further academic inquiry. 
## Audience
The primary audience includes HCI researchers, students specializing in computer science, communication, and psychology, and professionals in tech areas. Secondary audiences may be journal editors and conference organizers who seek to understand emerging research trends.
## Data Approach
The primary data source for this project will be downloaded from Web of Science. I will extract bibliometric data, such as article titles, authors, publication years, citations, keywords, and abstracts. The data will be structured as relational database tables for articles, authors, and citations as the CSV file. 
Initial Visualization Ideas
My strategy will encompass performance analysis and science mapping techniques (Donthu et al., 2021). For performance analysis, I will begin by presenting a historical timeline of publication volumes using bar charts. This will then be complemented by identifying top contributors, including bar charts ranking top authors, institutions, and countries based on publication count and citation impact. I will also visualize citation patterns, using scatter plots to present the relationship between publication year and citation count, highlighting the most influential articles. For science mapping, I will employ network analysis techniques to generate keyword networks to identify major research themes and their relationships, supplemented by heatmaps.
I will lastly isolate virtual reality studies by applying keyword filtering and replicate the visualization strategies. Adjustments may be made to the visualization or analysis strategy to better capture trends within this specific area.
## Limitations and Future Directions
This project is limited in its ability to capture the complete landscape as it only analyzed selected HCI journals. While selected journals are top venues in the field, a comprehensive understanding of research trends would require examining a broader range of sources such as conference proceedings, and comparing patterns across the wider literature including but not limited to communication, computer science, and psychology.

For the first milestone of my project, I undertook a detailed examination of the dataset I acquired from the Web of Science. My initial task was to understand the type of information available and determine which data points would be most useful for my analysis and visualization needs. I decided to employ the paper title, authors and their affiliations, citation counts, publication year, and keywords. However, I am open to adjusting this list as the project evolves.

To begin actual data handling, I merged several files downloaded from the Web of Science into a single data frame. I then proceeded to drop columns (i.e., 'Book Authors', 'Book Editors', 'Book Group Authors', 'Book Author Full Names') that were not relevant to my analysis for the tidy dataset. The first analytical step involved visualizing annual publication trends across two significant journals: COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR (CHB) and INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES (HCS). This analysis revealed that while CHB showed a rising trend in publications until 2016 before stabilizing, HCS maintained a more constant output without significant fluctuations. The standard deviation in yearly publications for CHB was around 230, compared to only 23 for HCS, indicating much greater variability in CHB's publication volume. Initially, I created separate graphs for the total and each journal's publication trends but then integrated these into a single interactive graph using Plotly’s updatemenus feature, allowing audiences to select which journal trend they wish to view. This step enhanced the user interaction aspect of the visualization. 

For the analysis of the top 30 authors, after extracting and separating individual authors from the aggregated units, I faced a challenge with the lack of detailed affiliation information. I tackled this by parsing the 'addresses' field with regular expressions to extract more detailed information about the authors' affiliations (i.e., institutions and countries). Once I identified the pattern and extracted the affiliations, I matched these details against my list of the top 30 authors to populate their respective information in a new data frame. However, three author data points among the top 30 authors were missing, and I had no idea about the code issues and had to add them manually. The resulting visualization not only displayed the number of publications per author but also color-coded these by the author's country, adding an additional layer of insight.

Moving forward, I used methodologies similar to those used for extracting top author data to also identify the top 30 affiliations and highlight the most influential institutions in the HCI field. Following the affiliations analysis, I extracted the top 50 papers based on citation counts. I employed a color-coding scheme in my visualizations to differentiate papers by the year of publication. This analysis revealed that papers with high citation counts predominantly originated from the period before 2015. I realized the length of time since publication has a significant impact on citation counts and prompted a subsequent analysis focused exclusively on papers published after 2015 to understand how recent publications in terms of impact and citation trends.

In the next step, I plan to extend my analysis to papers published after 2020 to ensure a comprehensive understanding of current and emerging research trends within HCI. This will involve a detailed examination of publication themes. An essential component of my upcoming work will involve an analysis of keywords. Initially, I will compile and analyze keywords from all periods to identify overarching research trends. This will be followed by segmenting the keyword analysis by specific time frames to pinpoint hot topics and shifts in research focus over time. This stratified approach will allow for a nuanced understanding of the evolution of research themes within HCI.

In the second phase of the project, I continumd the performance analysis on bibliometric indicators based on the methodology outlined by Donthu et al. (2021). I calculated several key metrics such as total citations (TC), average citations per publication (AC), number of cited publications (NCP), and the proportion of cited publications (PCP). While these metrics offer valuable insights into the impact and reach of the publications, I am still contemplating the best ways to integrate these data points into my visualizations effectively.

To better analyze keywords for research trend visualizations, I initially normalized the 'Author Keywords' into a new column listing keywords, which streamlined the handling and processing of the data. Utilizing the explode function, I separated each publication's multiple keywords to facilitate frequency analysis. This allowed me to identify top 30 keywords for various time periods: all-time, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s. Subsequent bar charts highlighted these keywords and their frequencies, revealing "social media" as a consistently dominant topic across most time periods within the HCI field and platforms like Twitter and Facebook frequently studied by researchers. Notably, "virtual reality" has emerged as a hot topic in the 2020s. To enhance efficiency, I added dropdown menus to make them interactive. However, I'm encountering an issue where, although my code runs correctly, the images do not display. I will need to debug this in the later stages. To facilitate a more intuitive exploration of research keywords, I implemented word clouds for visualizing the top keywords for each period. This visualization technique was effective in immediately conveying the most prominent research terms of each era to the audience.

To deepen the analysis, I plan to conduct a co-word analysis to explore the relationships between keywords. This will involve more sophisticated data processing and potentially the use of network analysis tools such as NetworkX. The ultimate goal is to also incorporate a visualization of co-authorship and co-keywords networks, which will provide further insights into the collaborative patterns and thematic connections in this field.

In this thrid milestone, I focused on enhancing the visualization aspects and improving the code for better data representation. 

First, I unified the color palette for the annual publication trends figures, creating more cohesive visualizations. Additionally, I introduced a new pie chart comparing publication volumes between COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR and INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES, which clearly showed the former's significant dominance in publication numbers. One of the major improvements was the extraction of first authors' countries from the 'Addresses' field using regular expressions and visualization of global distribution. I standardized country names to lowercase to ensure consistency. The global map visualization revealed that the USA, China, UK, Germany, Spain, and South Korea are the leading countries in HCI publications. An interesting technical challenge arose when the original data used 'England' instead of 'United Kingdom', so I had to modify this to ensure proper recognition by the px locationmode parameter. I also enhanced the annual publication trend visualization by incorporating color-coding for the top 5 countries' yearly publication volumes in the bar chart. This addition provides a clear visual representation of each active country's contribution over time. While reviewing the top 30 affiliations, I noticed a strong US presence and decided to create a state-level visualization using px.choropleth with locationmode='USA-states'. This revealed an interesting pattern showing that East Coast institutions are more active in HCI research compared to those on the West Coast.

During reviewing top 50 most cited papers, I identified limitations in the initial bar chart visualization. The long paper titles not only affected the visual aesthetics but also failed to provide insights into research trends. To address these limitations, I decided to enhance the visualization using keyword co-occurrence analysis, which offer a more deep understanding of thematic relationship in hot papers. 

In the next phase of my project, I plan to focus on expanding the co-word network analysis. I will develop a comprehensive co-word network encompassing all articles in the dataset to provide a broad overview of the entire HCI research landscape. Second, I will create a focused co-word network specifically for VR-related articles.
